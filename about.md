Hello, I am Job and I am a programmer from Seattle and I get a kick out of solving problems. I am interested in compilers, server side programming, and pure math. I also love coffee :-)


### Software Projects
Not yet in the software industry but have contributed to:

    - [Coalton](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton), a programming languaged used to build quantum computing software.
         - I added support for automatic differentiation. See original PR [here](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton/pull/890). It was merged [here](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton/pull/926)
	 
    - [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project), compiler infrastracture that enables you to build concrete compilers. LLVM is used by Google, Apple, Nvidia and many other companies.

           - You can see my patches [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AJobhdez+is%3Aclosed)

    - [x86 compiler](https://github.com/Jobhdez/pyhs), a compiler I wrote in Haskell that generates x86-64 runnable assembly for if expressions, tuples, let expressions, arithmetic, bool comparisons.
