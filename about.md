### Hello!

![image](/assets/ajob.jpeg)

I am Job -- a programmer from Seattle, WA.

Fortunately, I am have learned to appreciate programming independent of the programming language I am using and the program I am building; nevertheless, I have a big interest in functional programming, namely Lisp and Haskell. 

Over the years, I have worked on web development, computer algebra, and compilers and I have gotten a kick out solving problems in these domains, but I am very interested in compilers because these systems are large and complex. 

The classic textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" changed my life; reading this book -- when I was first starting out -- made me cry of joy.
