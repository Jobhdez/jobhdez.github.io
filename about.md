Hello, I am Job and I am a programmer from Seattle and I get a kick out of solving problems. I am interested in compilers, server side programming, and pure math. I also love coffee :-)


### Software Projects
I have contributed to:

- [Coalton](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton)

a programming language used to build quantum computing software. I added support for automatic differentiation. See original PR [here](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton/pull/890). It was merged [here](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton/pull/926).

- [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)

compiler infrastructure that enables you to build concrete compilers. LLVM is used by Google, Apple, Nvidia and many other companies.
You can see my patches [here](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commits?author=Jobhdez).

- [x86 compiler](https://github.com/Jobhdez/pyhs)

a compiler I wrote in Haskell that generates x86-64 runnable assembly for if expressions, tuples, let expressions, arithmetic, bool comparisons.
