Hello!

I am a software developer from Seattle, WA.

I am interested in compilers, PL, formal methods, and functional programming.

That is, I want to prove programs correct in Haskell! I have also written some Lisp and some Python.

If you have any questions reach out to me at hj93@protonmail.com or through Twitter. 

Thanks for reading!
