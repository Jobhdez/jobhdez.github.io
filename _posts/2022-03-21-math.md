# Why is math interesting

In "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences" Eugene Wigner claimed that abstract mathematics, in some cases, is necessary in some physical theories. How can pure mathematics, developed without any practical applications in mind, be necessary in the formulation of physical theories? I find this tremendously remarkable. It is a source of great joy to think about the necessity of complex numbers in the formulation of the laws of quantum mechanics. Why did mathematicans invented complex numbers? Complex numbers were invented so every quadratic equation had roots. If we wish, for example, for $$ {x^2} + 1 = 0 $$ to have roots we need to introduce the symbols $$ i $$ and $$ - i $$. So how is it that something invented by mathematicans become a necessity for the formulation of laws of quantum mechanics? As Wigner said in this paper: 

"It is difficult to avoid the impression that a miracle confronts us here, quite comparable in its striking nature to the miracle that the human mind can string a thousand arguments together without getting itself into contradictions, or to the two miracles of the existence of laws of nature and of the human mindâ€™s capacity to divine them."

Fruther, I also find interesting the fact that the universe has mathematical structure; space-time, for example, is a manifold which in turn is a topological space which is a set. The universe is how it is due to its mathematical structure.


# Math and Programming

Consider $$ \sum_{i=1}^n $$.

The sigma notation $$ \sum $$ is an abstraction that mathematicans figured out to talk about sums abstractly without worrying about particular sums. This notation expresses the concept of summation. Similarly, in programming you can express the same abstraction using a higher-order procedure.
Consider this procedure in Scheme:

{% highlight scheme %}
(define (sum-integers i n)
   (sum (lambda (x) x)
        i
        (lambda (s) (+ s 1))
        n))

(define (sum term i next n)
   (if (> i n)
       0
       (+ (term i)
          (sum term (next i) next n))))
{% endhighlight %}

By writing this higher-order procedure you can think at a higher level of abstraction; that is, instead of writing procedures of particular sums you can apply the same summation pattern to multiple sums.

In this way, math and programming are related.
