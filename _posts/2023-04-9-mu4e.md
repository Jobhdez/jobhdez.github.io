title: "How to use Emacs as an email client for protonmail"

### Emacs is amazing
Emacs is amazing. I am finally appreciating the power of emacs which to me is being able to use Emacs an operating system. One of the things you can use Emacs for is as an email client using mu4e. I will speak in particular about `protonmail`. For this to work you need `protonmail bridge`.

### Dependencies 
You will need to install `mu` and `isync`

### .mbsyncrc
First you will need to an `.mbsyncrc` but you need to make: `mkdir ~/.mbsyncrc`.

Paste the following to this file:

```
IMAPAccount protonmail
Host 127.0.0.1
Port 1143
User <your-email>
PassCmd "gpg -q --for-your-eyes-only --no-tty -d ~/.authinfo.gpg | awk 'FNR == 1 {print $8}'"
SSLType STARTTLS
SSLVersions TLSv1.2
CertificateFile ~/.config/protonmail/bridge/cert.pem

IMAPStore remote
Account protonmail

#You can change .mail to something else
MaildirStore local
Path ~/.mail/
Inbox ~/.mail/INBOX/

Channel inbox 
Far :remote:
Near :local:
Patterns * 
Create Both
Expunge Both
SyncState *

Group protonmail
Channel inbox
```

For this to work you will need to make `/protonmail/bridge/` inside `/.config/`; login to  the `protonmail bridge` app and export `cert.pem` and move it inside `/.config` and described.

Next, you need to create an `.authinfo` file -- i.e., `mkdir ~/.authinfo` and paste this:

### Authentication
```
# -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: (<your-email>) -*-
machine 127.0.0.1 port 1143 login USERNAME@protonmail.com password BRIDGE_PASSWORD
machine 127.0.0.1 port 1025 login USERNAME@protonmail.com password BRIDGE_PASSWORD
```

You will need to encrypt this file and to do this you need to do this:

`gpg -c .authinfo`
 And now delete `.authinfo`; you will now have an `.authinfo.gpg`

### Generate gpg key
To be able to send an email though you will need to generate a gpg key associated with the email in the top of your `.authinfo`. Emacs will try to decrypt the file
before it sends the email. To generate the key do this:

```
gpg --gen-key
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys <your-email> > mykey.asc
```

This is actually what the line `# -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: (<your-email>) -*-` is for on top of your `.authinfo` file.

### Sync
Next, type this in the terminal:

```
mu init --maildir ~/.mail
mu index
mbsync protonmail
```

### mu4e emacs config

Finally, you need to configure your `.emacs` files; copy and past the following:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e/")
(require 'mu4e)

(setq mu4e-maildir "~/.mail"
mu4e-attachment-dir "~/Downloads")

(setq user-mail-address "<your-email>
user-full-name  <your-name>)

;; Get mail
(setq mu4e-get-mail-command "mbsync protonmail"
mu4e-change-filenames-when-moving t   ; needed for mbsync
mu4e-update-interval 120)             ; update every 2 minutes

;; Send mail
(setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
smtpmail-auth-credentials "~/.authinfo.gpg"
smtpmail-smtp-server "127.0.0.1"
smtpmail-stream-type 'starttls
smtpmail-smtp-service 1025)

(add-to-list 'gnutls-trustfiles (expand-file-name "~/.config/protonmail/bridge/cert.pem"))
```
### Basics of mu4e
To access your `mu4e` file you can use your package manager to tell you where `mu` is located. When I did this I got the file `/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/mu4e/`. It could be slightly different on your machine.
Now, mu4e is ready to be used which you can do by:

```
M-x mu4e
navigate to the email you want to reply for instance and type:

M-x mu4e-compose-reply
C-c C-c to send the email
```

You can get a list of the mu4e commands by typing `M-x mu4e-` and typing enter.

Enjoy -- happy programming
