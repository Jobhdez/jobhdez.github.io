Mathematics is deep and beautiful. Mathematics is not only a tool to calculate. As Einstein said:

> the universe has mathematical structure

When I read the `Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics` by Eugene Wigner I started marveling about the beauty of mathematics. 

To illustrate this I am going to talk about quarks and group theory. How were quarks discovered? Around the middle of the 20th century scientists started discovering hadrons. Murray Gell-Mann then classified these hadrons as an $SU(3)$ group.

In group theory a group is the following.

A group is a set G together with a law of composition that has the following properties:

1. The law of composition is associative: $$(ab)c = a(bc) for\\ all\\ a, b, c \in G$$
   
2. $G$ contains an identity element 1 such that $$1a = a, a1 = a for\\ all\\ a \in G$$
   
3. Every element $a$ of $G$ has an inverse, an element $$b\\ such\\ that\\ ab=1, ba=1$$

The $$SU(3)$$ is such a group that consists of 8 matrices.

The beauty of mathematics that I see is the realization that quarks were deduced and discovered from this mathematical structure. How can this be? How can it be that a mathematical structure was used to discover something physical? Mathematical objects are abstract objects after all which are causally inert; so how can this be? This question is part of the beauty of mathematics.

Another example is the theory of general relativity; this theory also has mathematical structure. The mathematical structures of general relativity consist of the differential geometry structure `manifold`. A manifold is a set with additional information. The theory of general relativity dictates that matter leads to the curvature of spacetime and in turn the curvature leads to the motion of matter - i.e., gravity. So, in a sense the mathematical structure of the universe gives it its flow.

As Wigner pointed out in the above essay, how can mathematical structures that were created with no application in mind become a necessity for the formulation of theories in physics. Why is this? Consider that mathematical objects, if you are a platonist, are abstract objects that exist outside of spacetime. As a consequence, mathematical objects are causally inert. So, how can it be that the universe has mathematical structure? 

Could it be like Dirac believed that pure mathematics and theoretical physics will converge?

What is the best explanation for the deep and beautiful relationship between pure mathematical structures and the universe?

For an atheist this is just a happy coincidence. But for a theist, God is the interface between the platonic realm of mathematical objects and the four dimensional universe.

So, as you can see the relationship between pure mathematics and physics raises deep philosophical questions. And the above examples are only a few examples. There are many more of these examples.

This is the beauty of mathematics as I see it. Mathematics is full of profound mystery. It is truly a beautiful subject. So, I strongly believe that mathematics is discovered. 

As Richard Feynman said:

> to appreciate nature you need mathematics

I am not an expert in math but I have studied the basics of group theory and it gave me tremendous power to appreciate nature. Of course, this is not to say that math is the only way to appreciate nature. But physics is the most fundamental of the sciences and to be able to appreciate the universe from a physics point of view you need mathematics.

The correspondence between math and physics and studying this correspondence is also a way for us to think about what it means to be human.

For me this level of appreciation and all the emotional effects it has on me leads me to believe that this is  what it means to be human; to be able to grasp the laws of the universe and see the mathematical structure is a uniquely human ability. 

Anyways, thanks for reading.
